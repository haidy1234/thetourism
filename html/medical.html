In a traditional “sand bath” therapy, the natives buried themselves up to their necks in the hot, dry sand of the desert. This was done to treat rheumatism, joint pain, infertility, and impotence, among other health problems.
Environmental therapy has become more prevalent recently, and people come worldwide to try it. Because of its good weather, high evaporation rate, low humidity, and beautiful nature, Siwa has become a popular place for vacationers who want to stay healthy.
Siwa Oasis is home to several hot springs used as treatment centers for the environment and is said to have water that can help heal psoriasis, rheumatism, and stomach problems. <br>
